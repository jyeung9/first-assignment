# Assignment-1
# 1. Implementation
# There were various parts that needed to be implemented. Syntax wise, I had
unclosed tags, and I wrote the path file for the anchor tag incorrectly (I
wrote the full path instead of just the file name). The online validators also
gave me warnings for not specifying the language of the document. I also
realized that paragraph tags must start and end on the same line (otherwise
the end tag will not be recognized as linked to the starting tag). File upload
wise, I hadn't realized that there needed to be just one index.html file in
the public_html folder. Furthermore, uploading to Github was a little
challenging. At one time, I was told that I had a fatal error regarding
existing repositories, and how I had no branches. I ended up deleting the
repository and relinking everything. 
# In terms of correct implementations, I wrote content in HTML files and
linked a CSS file for each HTML file. 
# 2. I collaborated with Yves Chen.
# 3. I've spent approximately 5-6 hours on this assignment
